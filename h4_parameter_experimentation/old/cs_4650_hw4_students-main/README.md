This homework is centered around the iPython notebook `notebooks/tagging.ipynb`. Run this notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions to respond to 1a. Then, for 1b you will implement shuffling for the dataset, for 1c you will incorporate pre-trained embeddings, and for 1d-1f you will change hyperparameters and write about how they affect training performance!
